                <p>Modern lifestyle barely leaves any room for healthy indulgence in a person’s routine; be it constant consumption of caffeinated products or easily available but unhealthy fast food choices. People rarely take time out from their busy schedule for something as important as their health. Work and other obligations consume most of one’s time and energy, pushing well being at back which should be given top most priority.</p>
                <p>It so happens when we don’t look after our own well being, our family does it for us; similarly Sankey Solutions took a wise decision for the wellness of the whole team by participating in ‘Pune Half Marathon’.</p>

                    <p>Pune Half Marathon took place in the sports hub Pune, on 9th December where around 55 of our employees among 16,000 people from various walks of life including the celebrities of national and international importance actively participated; one of them being Dr. Jack Daniels (an exercise physiologist, who has been feted as the World’s Best Running Coach) was present to bust the misconceptions present around running, share vital tips, and to inculcate fitness as a habit amongst all the generations.</p>
                    <p>For us it was an excellent opportunity, not only to create appreciation among our employees for fitness but also to train them in natural environment for better collaboration amongst themselves. Nature lends her hand in calming the mind while exercising energizes physically, when both, the mind and body are in harmony, it instinctively motivates one to do their best.<p>
                    <p>What’s better than the whole Sankey family running collectively to raise awareness for Fitness & Health, this Marathon gave a boost to our team spirit and develop much better sense of purpose which cannot be done within concrete walls.</p>

                    <p>Being in Mumbai, our team took a trip to Lonavala, day before the event to be well rested and be ready to run for the simple cause of one’s better health. Uniformly dressed the fierce and happy faces were doing something out of the routine, with no stress for meeting client expectations or authenticating artificial intelligence, it was a day devoted to team and how marvelously we work when our goals are aligned.</p>

This is what we aim to achieve by progressive learning which yields to development at individual level.</p>
                    <p>This marathon was a shove in right direction to start with ‘Sankey Fitness’ for all our employees, an activity which helps us learn while having fun; It’s to keep them motivated and to create an atmosphere where there’s space for uninterrupted innovation and growth.</p>

                    <p>To ensure our energy doesn’t turn into chaos Sankey Solutions rolled out the carpet for yet another office. Additional space is giving extra room for jamming sessions on and off work, this has further uplifted the innovative spirit while driving high synergy.

                    <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%"><strong>Why do we need solution mindset?</strong></p>
                    <p>With myriad of Tech start-ups flooding the market creating a scenario of rigorous competition, few companies stand out pushing others in the endless loop of facing the unavoidable mayhem. Survival in such testy waters takes more than good luck and abundant capital to back up.</p>
                    <p>Often the starts-up commit a common mistake of relying on everything except their own potential to endure the storm. Hence, the success rate of start-ups is not more than 10% while the rest 90% just stumble and fall. Even those which had better financial back up; especially those, as they raised funds too much too soon. Again, whether its equity or debt, one cannot rely only on outer world support, it is short lived if we don’t change gears internally at certain pace.Often the starts-up commit a common mistake of relying on everything except their own potential to endure the storm. Hence, the success rate of start-ups is not more than 10% while the rest 90% just stumble and fall. Even those which had better financial back up; especially those, as they raised funds too much too soon. Again, whether its equity or debt, one cannot rely only on outer world support, it is short lived if we don’t change gears internally at certain pace.</p>
                    <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%"><strong>How to implement solution mindset?</strong></p>
                    <p>The potential to face such scenarios lies within the company, its assets. Assets being values which are framework of the principles the company was built upon, aid in setting up objectives and the people, ones who utilise their abilities to help company attain those.</p>
                    <p>We have endured our uncertainties, persisted despite unfavourable situations, not because we were lucky few but because we had our goals aligned with our philosophy. The philosophy we believe in isn’t anything extraordinary rather essential.</p>
                    <p>Survival of any company depends upon the common beliefs shared by its people; these beliefs are reflected in every aspect of that company, be it recruiting the staff or handling projects, it’s how they set themselves apart because they have ‘Solution Mindset’ in place and work cohesively towards a planned outcome.</p>
                    <p>Crisis is faced by every organisation but what they do in that critical time is what averts the crisis. This attitude to find solutions in the time of need means having right solution mindset in place.</p>
                    <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%"><strong>What is solution mindset?</strong></p>
                    <p>Solution Mindset is a much broader concept than to come up with answers for difficult questions. It’s not about recommending solutions that we know but those that suit our customers; to be humble and learn, render customized solutions.</p>
                    <p>It is not only restricted to learning but also inspiring others. A person with solution mindset is not just a learner but majorly an optimistic person, one who is calm even in the face of diversity and handles crisis effectively.</p>
                    <p>We can collectively call them an effective leader, who sets an example for others to learn from. Encourages to be proactive and composed at the same time.</p>
                    <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%">How can Solution Mindset be developed?</p>
                    <p>Acceptance and Patience are the keys to Solution Mindset, acceptance of the situation no matter how complex, and patience to remain positive and hunt for possible ways relentlessly to averse the situation with the help of the team.</p>
                    <p>With rapidly evolving technology and business landscape, it has become essential to communicate our psyche successfully across the world and that can only happen when we are able to reflect the optimism we harbour and this is also an attribute of Solution mindset.</p>
                    <p>Having a solution mindset does not mean coming up with unrealistic solutions to the existing problems, it simply could be as simple as making the situation workable or in favour of business need despite of adverse situation and decoding a challenging problem one layer at a time. It is willingness to find a way when all you could see is none.</p>
                    <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%">It drives Sankey</p>
                    <p>Customer centricity is our philosophy; it’s what drives us. We take decisions keeping in mind the situation of our customer and aim to exceed their expectations. We believe the real impact is not when project is accomplished but when we make an impact on their business.</p>
                    <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%">How is it different from Skillset mindset?</p>
                    <p>Most organizations set the philosophy of learn once, and apply the same lifetime, no elbow room for innovation makes for monotonous routine, driving employees to rely solely on past experience.</p>
                    <p>Skillset mindset has shorter learning period and stretched application of their learnings for long time, sometimes for lifelong. This is where it hits roadblock, as there is no scope to unlearn and learn more evolved or improved ways of solving same problem. They will have to try something new and better or this will lead to redundancy which ends up in obsoletion.</p>
                    <p>In this context Solution mindset would make one agile to adapt to changes, where they explore the gambit of possible options available to them for enhancement of their personal as well as professional goals.</p>
                    <p>A mindset is usually the differentiator, skills are usually in abundance, one can work hard and with dedicated efforts can achieve mastery over a skill but when it comes to mindset this can set apart success from ordinary.</p>
                </div><br><br>
                <div class="modal-image" style="background-image: url('./assets/solution1.jpg');">
                </div><br><br>
                <div class="main-content">
                        <p>Solution mindset helps an individual to endure the challenges during the period of change. Mindset apart from innovative thinking is a collective of beliefs, accepted norms, and general approach to life.</p>
                        <p>It is a pattern found in those who naturally think disruptive, for them it is the only way to operate. They view the situations with an unintentional approach of amicably tackling them.</p>
                        <p>Skillset mindset is the reliance upon one single skill to get one through rest of their life which in this highly dynamic world is irrational. Skills requirement change as our scope of work diversifies, and one has to constantly update themselves with necessary skills to perform them.</p>
                        <p>One never stops learning, even when they are at the top of their game. Being the best means investing even more into learning new skills to stay updated with the market to maintain the top position by constant innovation.</p>
                        <p>Sankey Solutions consists of more than just syntax operating techs; we are a team of innovators, most fascinated by architecture and design patterns. Our inclination towards deriving the best for our client has always been stimulating for our team.</p>
                        <p>Skills are necessary but we encourage a person with solution mindset, who can utilise these skills even more skilfully when they have a creative thinking at place. This thought process is what sets Sankey Solutions apart.</p>
                        <p style="color: grey; font-size:24px;width:100%">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Skills are mandatory but solution mindset is the USP (unique selling proposition). It is not the culture of an organisation that affects its people but the other way around, the mindset of the people unanimously creates a culture which defines the organization.</p>
                        <p>This is why having right philosophy at place helps not just to business, but its employees, clients and partners as well. Just like sunlight is essential for a plant to grow, similarly <strong><i>Solution Mindset</i></strong> is needed for business to flow.</p>
